# Description
A ledge warp is a technique that allows Samus to warp back to a previous location. This can be used to skip backtracking in some places, and is one of the methods for invincibility. Unfortunately, its use cases are fairly restricted, as it requires a ledge to set up, and Samus to stay in morph form until warping back.

## Execution
It is important to note that this tech requires a specific animation on the ledge. Mantling is the animation where Samus steps up onto a ledge, not the one where she grabs it and pulls herself up. You also must be jumping to this ledge, walking up a one tile step will not work.

1. Jump towards a ledge in a way such that you will mantle it
2. Morph. This must be done exactly 2 frames before the mantle animation starts
3. You can now move anywhere while in morph form
4. To warp back, jump and unmorph while facing the original direction you stored the ledge in

There is a visual cue to know if you got the ledge warp. If you stopped holding right while pressing morph, you will land on top of the ledge if you get the ledge warp. If you fall off the ledge, you were too early. If you instead pop high up while in morph, you were one frame too late, which is a separate tech known as [Spaceball](./Spaceball.md).
