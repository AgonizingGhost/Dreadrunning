# Description
A Water Bomb Jump (WBJ) allows the player to gain extra height while underwater by bomb jumping, which is normally impossible. This allows access to areas where they would typically need either Spin Boost or Space Jump.

## Execution
This trick has two parts- the set-up and the WBJ itself. Note that this must all be underwater.

Set-up
1. Perform a bomb jump on the ground
2. Unmorph before touching the ground again

If you touch the ground while morphed or perform another bomb jump, you will have to repeat the set-up.

WBJ
1. Jump
2. Morph
3. Lay a bomb
4. Unmorph
5. Jump
6. Morph near the bomb
7. Unmorph to grab any ledge above you
