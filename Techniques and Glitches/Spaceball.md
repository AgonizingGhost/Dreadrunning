# Description
Spaceball is a technique where Samus will jump up in the air when morphing while mantling. While it doesn't grant any additional height over simply jumping, it can be faster than climbing a ledge and then jumping, or be useful if you need to be morphed at the peak of your jump.

## Execution
It is important to note that this tech requires a specific animation on the ledge. Mantling is the animation where Samus steps up onto a ledge, not the one where she grabs it and pulls herself up. You also must be jumping to this ledge, walking up a one tile step will not work.

1. Jump towards a ledge in a way such that you will mantle it
2. Morph. This must be done exactly 1 frame before the mantle animation starts

If you didn't get the spaceball, you should be careful that you didn't accidentally store a [ledge warp](./Ledge%20Warp.md) (performed the same way, but morphing one frame earlier), as this is disallowed in NMG. You can unstore the ledge warp without warping by simply unmorphing on the ground.
